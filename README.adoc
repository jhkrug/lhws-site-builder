= Longhorn asciidoc migration

Site builder for Longhorn asciidoc.

== Migration notes

=== Images

Need to move images from the LH repo to images diretory in the content repo. All
the image includes then just need to be modified to delete the prefix `/img/`
from the images resource path. That should be easy to automate.

=== Warning: section title out of sequence: expected level 1, got level 2

Lot's of these. Need to investigate why.

=== ERROR (asciidoctor): invalid part, must have at least one section (e.g., chapter, appendix, etc.)

Lots of these. Need to investigate why.
